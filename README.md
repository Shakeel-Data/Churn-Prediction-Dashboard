# Churn-prediction-Dashboard
Customer churn is one of the most significant challenges facing modern businesses. As markets become increasingly saturated, understanding why customers leave—and more importantly, how to retain them—has never been more critical. Churn analysis provides a data-driven approach to tackling this issue by uncovering behavioural trends and service-related factors that influence customer decisions. By integrating predictive modelling and actionable insights, organizations can shift from reactive responses to proactive engagement, ensuring stronger customer relationships and improved business outcomes.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Customer Churn Analysis for a telecom firm, utilizes SQL for ETL, leveraging Power BI for data visualization and Machine Learning (Random Forest) to identify churn patterns, predict future churners, and provide actionable insights. While the project is specific to telecom, its methodologies can be applied across industries such as retail, finance, and healthcare to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Relevant Sectors & Stakeholders
Understanding customer attrition is vital across industries. This project, initially designed for the telecom sector, provides a scalable framework for churn analysis applicable to finance, retail, and healthcare. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, businesses can proactively address churn, optimize retention strategies, and enhance customer lifetime value.

## Project Target
